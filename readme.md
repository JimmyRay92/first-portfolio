## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills as a devloper to my future or perspective employers. A portfolio is a great way to showcase the projects that I have done. Furthermore, I also added a way for people for contact me.


## Features
For this website I have built four pages in total. Every page has a nav bar which allows you to naviagte to different pages. I also added some animations to the anchor tag, once you click on it it will turn green in a timely fashion. Those tags also has a white border which looks like a button. This helps them to stand out from other texts. On the blogs page I also added images to showcase my abilities to include them as part of portfolio. I hvae used lines under each blog to separate them.


Throught the site I designed my website with a minimialistic and professional look my mind. I have achieved this through dividing my information into sections and have clear lines that separates them clearly into sections. In those section I also added lines which distinguish between different individual items. All of above, leads to a shared theme in my portfolio page.
