## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to show my skills as a developer. A portfolio is a great way to showcase the projects that I have done. Furthermore, I also added a way for people to contact me.


## Features
For this website, I have built four pages in total. Every page has a navbar that allows you to navigate to different pages. You can also find links to a variety of social media profiles on the home page. I also added some animations to each anchor tag. Those tags also have a blue border that looks like a button. It helps them to stand out from other texts. 


## Sitemap
The sitemap shows the number of pages and how they are connected.

#### Navbar
Navbar helps users to navigate between different pages. It's also handy that it stays at the top. So a user will always know where to find them.

#### Home page(Mobile)

The homepage showcases different components I have created. First off, I designed this website from a mobile-first approach. So I displayed my information in a row style from top to bottom.


There are four different components on this page. First off, there is a navbar at the top of the page. Secondly, there is an about me section with links to my social media.


#### Home page
